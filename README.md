RandomCoordinateDescent.py : Performs Random Coordinate Descent to find coefficients for lasso linear regression.
It accepts the input X and Y along with an initial estimate of coefficients (advised to be zero), 
lambda for lasso and max_iterations.
The stoppage condition for the optimizing algorithm is number of iteration. Each iteration consists of optimizing all the parameters one after the other in a random manner.
